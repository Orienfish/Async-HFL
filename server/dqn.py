Reinforcement Learning (DQN) Tutorial
=====================================
**Author**: `Adam Paszke <https://github.com/apaszke>`_
This tutorial shows how to use PyTorch to train a Deep Q Learning (DQN) agent
on the CartPole-v0 task from the `OpenAI Gym <https://gym.openai.com/>`__.
**Task**
The agent has to decide between two actions - moving the cart left or
right - so that the pole attached to it stays upright. You can find an
official leaderboard with various algorithms and visualizations at the
`Gym website <https://gym.openai.com/envs/CartPole-v0>`__.
.. figure:: /_static/img/cartpole.gif
   :alt: cartpole
   cartpole
As the agent observes the current state of the environment and chooses
an action, the environment *transitions* to a new state, and also
returns a reward that indicates the consequences of the action. In this
task, rewards are +1 for every incremental timestep and the environment
terminates if the pole falls over too far or the cart moves more then 2.4
units away from center. This means better performing scenarios will run
for longer duration, accumulating larger return.
The CartPole task is designed so that the inputs to the agent are 4 real
values representing the environment state (position, velocity, etc.).
However, neural networks can solve the task purely by looking at the
scene, so we'll use a patch of the screen centered on the cart as an
input. Because of this, our results aren't directly comparable to the
ones from the official leaderboard - our task is much harder.
Unfortunately this does slow down the training, because we have to
render all the frames.
Strictly speaking, we will present the state as the difference between
the current screen patch and the previous one. This will allow the agent
to take the velocity of the pole into account from one image.
**Packages**
First, let's import needed packages. Firstly, we need
`gym <https://gym.openai.com/docs>`__ for the environment
(Install using `pip install gym`).
We'll also use the following from PyTorch:
-  neural networks (``torch.nn``)
-  optimization (``torch.optim``)
-  automatic differentiation (``torch.autograd``)
-  utilities for vision tasks (``torchvision`` - `a separate
   package <https://github.com/pytorch/vision>`__).

# Replay Memory
# -------------
#
# We'll be using experience replay memory for training our DQN. It stores
# the transitions that the agent observes, allowing us to reuse this data
# later. By sampling from it randomly, the transitions that build up a
# batch are decorrelated. It has been shown that this greatly stabilizes
# and improves the DQN training procedure.
#
# For this, we're going to need two classses:
#
# -  ``Transition`` - a named tuple representing a single transition in
#    our environment. It essentially maps (state, action) pairs
#    to their (next_state, reward) result, with the state being the
#    screen difference image as described later on.
# -  ``ReplayMemory`` - a cyclic buffer of bounded size that holds the
#    transitions observed recently. It also implements a ``.sample()``
#    method for selecting a random batch of transitions for training.

# Finally, the code for training our model.

# Here, you can find an ``optimize_model`` function that performs a
# single step of the optimization. It first samples a batch, concatenates

# :math:`V(s_{t+1}) = \max_a Q(s_{t+1}, a)`, and combines them into our
# loss. By definition we set :math:`V(s) = 0` if :math:`s` is a terminal
# state. We also use a target network to compute :math:`V(s_{t+1})` for
# added stability. The target network has its weights kept frozen most of
# the time, but is updated with the policy network's weights every so often.
